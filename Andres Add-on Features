"""
My custom utilities for the group project.
Written by Andres — With comments that explain everything
so y’all know exactly what I added and why.

NOTE:
    - This script does NOT change the GUI.
    - This script plugs into the GUI using the same structure as generic.py.
    - All SQL is written for SQL Server.
    - If a table name doesn’t exist on your local database, the code safely fails
      and the GUI won’t crash.

How to use:
    - Add: `from my_utilities import DeviceHealthUtility, TableInfoUtility`
      in whichever main file you are integrating.
    - Then initialize these in UtilityApp the same way you did for SystemReliabilityUtility.
